======================================================
Confluence
======================================================

Currently a lot of documentation is maintained in Confluence. 
But it is disconnected from the source code and other information in the source code repository.

There are several tools to convert to and from `Confluence Storage Format <https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-storage-format-790796544.html>`_




Export to Confluence
=====================
There are several tools (including a `Sphinx extension <https://sphinxcontrib-confluencebuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ ) that can create Confluence format documentation and publish to Confluence.

Confluence Builder for Sphinx
----------------------------------------
This `Sphinx extension <https://sphinxcontrib-confluencebuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_

#. Enables a builder to generate Confluence-compatible markup documentation from Sphinx.
#. Enables a builder to publish to a Confluence instance.



See `example test output <https://jdknight.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/confluencebuilder/pages/813170943/v1.1>`_ and a demo video:

Atlassian token
--------------------------------
For Confluence Cloud, an api token can used for the password in ``conf.py`` 

.. code ::

    confluence_server_pass = APITokenValue

An API token can be obtained for your cloud hosted Confluence site from https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens.



Import from Confluence
======================

In general there's 2 ways to do this:

#. Export from Confluence
#. Scrape pages from Confluence

Export from Confluence
----------------------------------------
`Confluence Export Content <https://confluence.atlassian.com/confcloud/export-content-to-word-pdf-html-and-xml-724764824.html>`_ to XML exports pages in the `Confluence Storage Format <https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-storage-format-790796544.html>`_ (which is XHTML based, i.e. valid XML).
These can then be transformed into Markdown (or ReST) using XSLT.

There's several tools available for this:


Pandoc
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Some examples of projects that used Pandoc to convert from Confluence to RST:

#. http://udig-news.blogspot.com/2012/10/how-to-convert-from-confluence-to-sphinx.html

#. https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-5013 who went from https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/LDMDG#/ to https://developer.lsst.io/

#. https://www.npmjs.com/package/confluence-to-github-markdown I've used this in the past. It works but does need some cleanup (which can be automated).
