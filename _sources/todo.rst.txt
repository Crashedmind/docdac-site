To Do List
======================================================

Todo list is like Confluence Task List i.e. a report of open tasks across multiple pages is created.

The todo tasks and todo report can be added or removed from the output via todo_include_todos setting in conf.py:

.. code ::

    todo_include_todos = True #Default is False i.e. removed


Include the ``todolist`` directive in the rst file to get a list of all todos

.. code ::
    
    .. todolist::
