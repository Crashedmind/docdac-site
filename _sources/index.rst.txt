Welcome to DOCDAC's documentation!
=======================================

    *Documentation-Of-Code Documentation-As-Code*


.. tip ::
    Within 5 minutes, you can build this guide and all the diagrams in it, and the toolset, from source text files in GIT.

    .. code-block:: bash

        git clone ssh://git@bitbucket.verifone.com:7999/~chris_m11/docdac.git #get the documentation and toolset (Dockerfile) source text files
        cd ./docdac
        ./docker_build.sh # build toolset form Docker file 
        ./sphinx_build.sh # build this html guide using the toolset 

    You can then use this as the basis to integrate your own DoxyGen content into a modern, powerful, good-looking documentation that includes easily generated diagrams. 
    Click "View page source" on pages to see how they were written.

    #. Create your own content 
    #. Build it using ./sphinx_build.sh
    #. Give users useful documentation they will enjoy reading
